# Phase 10.7: Rate Limit Middleware and Tests (Deferred)

**Status:** Deferred to [Phase 14: Post-v1.0 Roadmap](../phase-14-future.md)

Rate limiting was removed from active Phase 10 scope to keep this phase focused on cache, redirect, cookie, and transport improvements.

This file is retained for planning traceability only. Do not implement:

- `Runtime/RateLimit/RateLimitMiddleware.cs`
- `Tests/Runtime/RateLimit/TokenBucketTests.cs`
