# Phase 3D: Internal JSON Parser Fallback for IL2CPP/AOT Platforms (Deprecated)

This document is deprecated as of Feb 6, 2026. The authoritative plan and implementation
details live in:

- `docs/phases/phase3d/overview.md`
- `docs/phases/phase3d/step-3d.*.md`

Reason: this older plan diverged from the step docs (API surface and task breakdown),
and keeping both risks implementing the wrong API. Use the step docs above for Phase 3D
work going forward.
